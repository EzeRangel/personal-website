			<div class="copy">
				I'm a software engineer who's all about frontend development. I have experience building
				optimized websites with React and more recently with Typescript. I have closely followed the
				React ecosystem and adopting the changes they propose, this has allowed me to work with both
				client-side and server-side rendered apps. I have also been able to work on mobile apps with
				React Native that are already in the app stores.
